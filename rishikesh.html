              <h4>Rishikesh - "Place of sages"</h4>
              <p>
                <span>Rishikesh</span>, also known as the 'place of sages' is
                Haridwar, at the confluence of the Chandrabhaga and Ganga. It is
                believed that God by the name of 'Hrishikesh' had appeared as an
                answer to the hard penances by Rabhiya Rishi and henceforth the
                place derived its name.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span>Rishikesh</span> is a small town in the northern state of
                Uttarakhand in India. Scenically located where the Ganges River
                comes down from the Himalayas, Rishikesh catapulted to Western
                fame when the Beatles dropped by for a visit to Maharishi Mahesh
                Yogi's ashram (now closed), and the town is still known as the
                world capital of yoga. Rishikesh is also the Gateway to the
                Himalayas in the Tehri-Garhwal region of Uttar Pradesh. The Char
                Dham Yatra (Four Shrines Sacred Journey) ideally begins from
                Rishikesh. The spectacle of the Ganga rushing through the
                Himalayan foothills is an awesome sight. Several temples dot the
                banks of the Ganga at Rishikesh.Rishikesh is located at a height
                of about 1360 feet above sea level. It is believed that several
                yogis and sages lived and practised penance here. Rishikesh
                represents the site where Vishnu vanquished the demon Madhu.

                are made to these creatures. The freshness of the air, and sound
                of flowing water, the scenic beauty of the region and the
                distant sound of bell chimes create an unforgettable experience
