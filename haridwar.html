              <h2>Haridwar Tour Package.</h2>
              <h4>Haridwar - "The Temple City"</h4>
              <p>
                <span>Haridwar</span>, one of the most holy cities for Hindus,
                literally means 'Gateway to God'. Legend goes that the
                Suryavnshi (belonging to Sun Dynasty) Prince Bhagirath performed
                penance here to salvage the souls of his ancestors who had
                perished due to the curse of the sage Kapila. The penance was
                answered and the river Ganga trickled forth from Lord Shiva's
                locks and its bountiful waters revived the sixty thousand sons
                of King Sagara. Mythologically, drops of nectar churned out from
                the primordial ocean fell at the four sites of the Kumbh mela,
                including Haridwar. The Kumbh mela, happening once every 12
                years and the Ardha Kumbha Mela, every six years are big draws.
                Haridwar is said to be visited by every god, to perform penance
                and meditation here.
              </p>
              <div>
                <img src="./images/haridwar.jpg" />
              </div>
              <p>
                <span> The Ganga</span> leaves the mountains and enters the
                plains at Haridwar, becoming very quite and calm. It is said
                that taking bath here purifies the soul and opens the way for
                the ultimate freedom, the Nirvana. Haridwar has come up as a
                major learning center for arts, science and culture. This place
                has maintained the Gurukul traditions of teaching. Haridwar has
                since ages been a source of Ayurvedic medicines and has been
                providing herbal remedies. One of the first towns to be
                developed on Ganges, Haridwar is still lush and green with
                forest and trees. With Rajaji park in the vicinity Haridwar has
                also been the destination for the wildlife and nature lovers.
                The city acquires a unique charm in the evening when the ghats
                become breath takingly beautiful with thousands of Diyas and
                Marigold floating in the waters of Ganges.
              </p>
              <h2>How to Reach Haridwar</h2>

                km) of Dehradun. From Dehradun, one can take a train / bus or
                hire a taxi to reach Haridwar. If coming from any city outside
                India, it will be better to take a flight to Delhi (200 km) and
                then reach Haridwar by train or bus.

                good option, since the journey is not only comfortable, by also
                proves to be very economical. Haridwar has its own railway
                station, with trains connecting it with major cities like
                Mumbai, Delhi, Dehradun, and Rishikesh, besides others. Trains
                like Shatabdi Express, Jan Shatabdi Express, Ujjaini Express,
                Mussoorie Express and Doon Express regularly ply between Delhi
                and Haridwar.

                Bhartrihari. Har ki Paudi means Steps (Paudi) of Shiva (Hari).
                It is believed that Shiva and Vishnu have visited the ghat in
                the Vedic Era. The ghat is said to have a large footprint,
                supposed to be that of Vishnu. Legends have it that Brahma had
                performed a Yagna (Prayers) at the banks of Ganga, on Har ki
                Paudi.
              </p>

                the Neel Parvat. The modern temple was constructed by Suchat
                Singh, ruler of Kashmir, in 1929 AD. The temple is a 3 km trek
                from Chandi Ghat. It is believed that the main statue was

                Devi Tetple is also accessible by a ropeway, which starts near

                <span>Maya Devi Temple</span> : The temple is said to be at the
                site of the place where heart and navel of Sati fell. The temple
                is amongst one of the Shaktipeeths in India.
              </p>

                is 4 Km from Haridwar. The mythological story about this place,
                is that king Daksha Prajapati, father of Sati (Lord Shivas first
                wife) performed yagya at this place. Daksha Prajapati did not
                invite Lord Shiva and Sati felt insulted. Therefore, she burnt
                herself in the yagya kund. This incident provoked the disciples
                and followers of Mahadev, who killed King Daksha, but later on
                Lord Mahadev brought him back to life. Daksha Mahadev temple is

                - The sacred tank, which is situated at a distance of 1 km from

                River. The Ganga flows in seven streams in front of this Ashram,

                houses uncountable number of temples. The temples of Haridwar
                are of high religious importance, as Haridwar is amongst the
                most sacred cities of India. As per myths, Haridwar has been
                visited by Gods and Goddesses as a part of performing penances.

                mela. One of the four sites of Kumbh Mela, Haridwar hosts Kumbh
                mela every 12th year, on Har-ki-Paudi. The Kumbh Mela is the
                most revered Hindu fair. It is believed that during Kumbh Mela
                in Haridwar, water of Ganga acquires medicinal properties. A
                bath in Ganga, during Kumbh Mela, is therefore considered very
                beneficial.
